% Even this C example is misleading since none of the issues
% of memory management of the strings has been dealt with.
% The S-Lang language hides all these issues from the user.

%  Binary operators have been defined to work with the
%  string data type. In particular the + operator may
%  be used to perform string concatenation. That is,
%  one can use the + operator as an alternative to
%  strcat:

define concat_3_strings (a, b, c)
{

   return a + b + c;
}
