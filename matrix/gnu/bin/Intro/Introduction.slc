% 2. Introduction

%  S-Lang is a powerful interpreted language that may be
%  embedded into an application to make the application
%  extensible. This enables the application to be used
%  in ways not envisioned by the programmer, thus
%  providing the application with much more flexibility
%  and power. Examples of applications that take advantage
%  of the interpreter in this way include the jed editor
%  and the slrn newsreader.
