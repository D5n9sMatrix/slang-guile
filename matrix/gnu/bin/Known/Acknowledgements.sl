% Since I first released S-Lang, I have received a lot
% feedback about the library and the language from many
% people. This has given me the opportunity and pleasure
% to interact with a number of people to make the library
% portable and easy to use. In particular, I would like
% to thank the following individuals:

%  Luchesar Ionkov for his comments and criticisms of the
%  syntax of the language. He was the person who made me
%  realize that the low-level byte-code engine should be
%  totally type-independent. He also improved the tokenizer
%  and preparser and impressed upon me that the language
%  needed a grammar.

%  Mark Olesen for his many patches to various aspects of
%  the library and his support on AIX. He also contributed
%  a lot to the pre-processing (SLprep) routines.

%  John Burnell for the OS/2 port of the video and keyboard
%  routines. He also made value suggestions regarding the
%  interpreter interface.

%  Darrel Hankerson for cleaning up and unifying some of the
%  code and the makefiles.

%  Dominik Wujastyk who was always willing to test new
%  releases of the library.

%  Michael Elkins for his work on the curses emulation.

%  Hunter Goatley, Andy Harper, Martin P.J. Zinser, and Jouk
%  Jansen for their VMS support.

%  Dave Sims and Chin Huang for Windows 95 and Windows NT
%  support, and Dino Sangoi for the Windows DLL support.

%  I am also grateful to many other people who send in
%  bug-reports, bug-fixes, little enhancements, and
%  suggestions, and so on. Without such community
%  involvement, S-Lang would not be as well-tested
%  and stable as it is. Finally, I would like to thank
%  my wife for her support and understanding while I
%  spent long weekend hours developing the library.
