% 2.2 Language Features

%  The language features both global and local variables,
%  branching and looping constructs, user-defined functions,
%  structures, datatypes, and arrays. In addition, there is
%  limited support for pointer types. The concise array
%  syntax rivals that of commercial array-based numerical
%  computing environments.
